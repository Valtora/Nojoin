## Why Nojoin?

Most meeting assistants require you to invite them to join your meetings or upload sensitive business conversations to the cloud. Nojoin is different.

- 🔒 **100% Private:** Audio and transcripts never leave your server (unless you want them to for LLM processing).
- 🚀 **Unlimited:** No monthly limits on recording minutes.
- 🧠 **Smart:** Uses OpenAI Whisper (Turbo) for transcription and Pyannote for speaker identification.
- 💬 **Interactive:** Chat with your meetings using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Ollama.
- ✨ **Best of All:** Nojoin doesn't need to join awkwardly on your meetings.

## ⚡ Quick Start

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/Valtora/Nojoin && cd Nojoin`
2.  **Launch:** `docker compose up -d`
3.  **Use:** Open `https://localhost:14443` (Accept self-signed cert warning)
4.  **Configure:** Follow the first-run wizard to set up API keys and preferences.
5.  **Companion App:** Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Valtora/Nojoin/releases) page download, install, and connect the companion app on client machines to start recording audio.

    *See [Installation & Setup](#installation--setup) for CPU-only mode and configuration details.*

    *   **Role-Based Access:** Owner, Admin, and User roles with granular permissions.
    *   **Invitation System:** Secure registration via invite links with expiration and usage limits.
    *   **User Data:** Complete data cleanup on user deletion (files, database records, and logs).

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Nojoin is composed of three distinct subsystems:

1.  **The Server (Dockerized):**
    *   Hosted on a machine with NVIDIA GPU capabilities.
    *   Runs the API (FastAPI), Worker (Celery), Database (PostgreSQL), and Broker (Redis).
    *   Handles all heavy lifting: VAD, Transcription, and Diarization.

2.  **The Web Client (Next.js):**
    *   The primary interface for users.
    *   Provides a dashboard for playback, transcript editing, and system configuration.

3.  **The Companion App (Rust):**
    *   Runs on client machines (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Sits in the system tray and handles audio capture.
    *   Uploads audio to the server for processing.

## 🔑 API Keys & Configuration

Nojoin requires certain API keys to function fully. The first-run wizard will request these keys but they can also be entered in the **Settings** -> **AI Services** page of the web interface after installation.

### Hugging Face Token (Required for Diarization)
To enable speaker diarization (identifying who is speaking), you need a Hugging Face token.
1.  Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
2.  Generate an Access Token (Read permissions).
3.  Accept the user conditions for the following models:
    *   [`pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1`](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1)
4.  Enter this token in the Nojoin **Settings > AI Settings**.

### LLM Providers (Optional)
To use the "Chat with Meeting" and "Generate Notes" features, you need an API key from one of the supported providers:
*   **OpenAI**
*   **Anthropic**
*   **Google Gemini**
*   **Ollama** (Local LLMs - no API key required, but requires setup)

## 👥 User Management

Nojoin includes a robust user management system designed for self-hosted environments.

### Roles
*   **Owner:** The first user created is automatically assigned the Owner role. Has full system access and cannot be deleted.
*   **Admin:** Can manage users, create/revoke invites, and view system settings.
*   **User:** Standard access to record and manage their own meetings.

### Invitation System
Registration is restricted to invited users only.
1.  **Create Invite:** Admins generate invite links with specific roles (Admin/User), expiration dates, and usage limits.
2.  **Revoke:** Invites can be revoked at any time to prevent further signups while keeping a record of the code.
3.  **Delete:** Revoked invites can be permanently deleted from the system.

### Data Cleanup
When a user is deleted, Nojoin performs a **hard delete** of all associated data to ensure privacy:
*   **Files:** Audio recordings and proxy files are physically removed from the disk.
*   **Database:** User account, recordings, transcripts, chat history, and speaker profiles are cascaded and removed.
*   **Anonymization:** Invitations created by the deleted user are preserved but anonymized (orphaned) to maintain invite code validity for other users.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   **Docker Desktop**
*   **NVIDIA GPU** (Optional, but highly recommended for faster processing).

### Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Valtora/Nojoin
    cd Nojoin
    ```

2.  **Start the Stack:**

    **Option A: NVIDIA GPU (Default)**
    Requires an NVIDIA GPU. Much faster processing.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    **Option B: CPU**
    Works on all systems. Slower processing speeds.
    
    Open `docker-compose.yml` and comment out the `deploy` section under the `worker` service.
    
    Then run:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    *Note: The first run may take several minutes as it needs to download large Docker images.*

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   **Web Interface:** Open `https://localhost:14443`
        *   *Note: You will see a "Not Secure" warning because of the self-signed certificate.*
    *   **Remote Access:** To access from another machine or domain, configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in your `.env` file. See `.env.example` for details.

### Using Local LLMs (Ollama)
If you are running Ollama on the same machine as the Nojoin Docker containers, you must use the special Docker host address:
*   **API URL:** `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
*   Do **not** use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the container cannot see the host's localhost.

### Running the Companion App

1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Valtora/Nojoin/releases) page.
2.  Download the executable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3.  Run the application. It will appear in your system tray.
4.  The web app also has a 'Download Companion App' button that will take you to the above link.

*Note: For developers, you can still build from source by navigating to the `companion` directory and running `cargo run --release`.*

> **🧪 Call for Testing:** The Companion App has been tested on Windows. We are looking for community feedback on **macOS** and **Linux** stability. Please report any OS-specific issues on GitHub.

## 📦 Editions

*   **Community Edition:** This is the free and open-source version of Nojoin, designed for self-hosting and community support. It includes all core features for recording, processing, and analyzing meetings.
*   **Enterprise Edition:** (Coming Soon) A paid version designed for larger organizations. It will include additional deployment options, advanced administration features, and dedicated support.
