## Meeting Name Inference - Low Priority - Potential TODO
Implement a first-pass attempt at inferring a title for the meeting based on the context within the transcript.

## LLM User Context - Medium Priority - Definite TODO
Allow the user to provide the LLMs with some custom context. E.g., their name, title, role, company, and whatever else they want to provide as context to the LLMs. This might help with improving meeting note quality and or provide general quality of life increase for the user.

## Advanced Meeting Analysis - Potential TODO
Implement advanced analyses for both the audio and transcript to gauge things like speaker sentiments, engagement, bias, etc. with a view to extract as much information as possible from the meetings' interactions. Look at things like time spent on topics.

## Codebase Polish - Definite TODO
Prune the codebase of unnecessary or overly verbose comments. Especially where code has been commented out and is now obsolete.

## Remove creation of 'transcripts' folder on start as its redundant now.
