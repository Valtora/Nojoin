## LLM User Context - Medium Priority - Potential TODO
Allow the user to provide the LLMs with some custom context. E.g., their name, title, role, company, and whatever else they want to provide as context to the LLMs. This might help with improving meeting note quality and or provide general quality of life increase for the user.

Implement advanced analyses for both the audio and transcript to gauge things like speaker sentiments, engagement, bias, etc. with a view to extract as much information as possible from the meetings' interactions. Look at things like time spent on topics.
