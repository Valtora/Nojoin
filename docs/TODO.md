## LLM User Context - Medium Priority - Potential TODO
Allow the user to provide the LLMs with some custom context. E.g., their name, title, role, company, and whatever else they want to provide as context to the LLMs. This might help with improving meeting note quality and or provide general quality of life increase for the user.

## Advanced Meeting Analysis - Potential TODO
Implement advanced analyses for both the audio and transcript to gauge things like speaker sentiments, engagement, bias, etc. with a view to extract as much information as possible from the meetings' interactions. Look at things like time spent on topics.

## Bug Fix - Speaker Management - Definite TODO
After merging a speaker and or being prompted to add the speaker to the Global Speaker Library (regardless of which option the user chose), pressing the 'Save' button in the Participants Dialog, looks to trigger Meeting Note Generation as the meeting note generation spinner appears but the user has to press 'Save' again for the process to actually begin and for the Participant Manager dialog to disappear.
