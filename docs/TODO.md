# Nojoin To-Do List

## Explore Implementing Beam Cloud Compatability

- Beam is an open-source cloud platform that lets you:
  - Run serverless workloads on CPUs and GPUs
  - Securely execute code generated by LLMs in Sandboxes
  - Launch containers in the cloud in under 1 second
  - Instantly deploy any existing Docker image as a REST API
  - Deploy task queues, scheduled jobs, and long-running functions with no timeouts
  - Automatically scale jobs to thousands of containers

- You only pay for the compute you use, by the millisecond of usage.
- See the `Docs/BeamCloud.md` file for more information.
- Let's explore how Nojoin could allow users to make use of a Beam Cloud instance to process their meetings. This would allow users to process their meetings at scale and potentially even process their meetings in parallel without requiring a local machine to do so.
- The user would need to authenticate with their own Beam Cloud account.
- The main reason we are considering implementing Beam Cloud is because it would allow Nojoin to become a fully hosted SaaS solution for those users that are not technical and just want to go to a website, download a companion, and begin recording meetings with zero technical setup and knowledge.

## Frontend: Remove setTimeOut in NotesView

- **Context**: `frontend/src/components/NotesView.tsx:229` uses `setTimeout` to ensure decorations are rendered.
- **Issue**: This is flaky and race-condition prone.
- **Task**: Replace with `MutationObserver`, `useLayoutEffect`, or editor callback to detect DOM readiness reliably.

## Frontend: Robust Popover Positioning

- **Context**: `frontend/src/components/SpeakerAssignmentPopover.tsx:55` uses manual calculation for positioning.
- **Issue**: Fragile, may detach from element.
- **Task**: Refactor to use `floating-ui` for robust positioning and portal handling.

## Companion: Semantic Versioning

- **Context**: `companion/src-tauri/src/main.rs:96` assumes any string difference is an update.
- **Issue**: String inequality != update (could be downgrade).
- **Task**: Use `semver` crate to compare versions properly (`new > current`).

## Companion: Standardize AppData Usage

- **Context**: `companion/src-tauri/src/main.rs:141` uses exe dir or current dir.
- **Issue**: Non-standard practice.
- **Task**: Standardize on `AppData` (or XDG equivalent) for all user data.

## Backend: Investigate Word-Level Timestamps in Transcript Utils

- **Context**: `backend/utils/transcript_utils.py:230-247` mentions naive text splitting due to missing word timestamps.
- **Issue**: Large segments are split arbitrarily, potentially breaking sentences or context.
- **Task**: Investigate passing word-level timestamps through the dict structure to enable precise semantic splitting.
