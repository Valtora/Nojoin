# Nojoin To-Do List

## Logs View Improvement

- Currently the logs are only generated when the user views the System page in the Settings. The logs should be generated at all times and populate the log view in the background.
- Perhaps we should consider having an ongoing async process to populate the logs continiously in the background and store them in the logs view? Let's discuss.

## Explore Implementing Beam Cloud Compatability

- Beam is an open-source cloud platform that lets you:
  - Run serverless workloads on CPUs and GPUs
  - Securely execute code generated by LLMs in Sandboxes
  - Launch containers in the cloud in under 1 second
  - Instantly deploy any existing Docker image as a REST API
  - Deploy task queues, scheduled jobs, and long-running functions with no timeouts
  - Automatically scale jobs to thousands of containers

- You only pay for the compute you use, by the millisecond of usage.
- See the `Docs/BeamCloud.md` file for more information.
- Let's explore how Nojoin could allow users to make use of a Beam Cloud instance to process their meetings. This would allow users to process their meetings at scale and potentially even process their meetings in parallel without requiring a local machine to do so.
- The user would need to authenticate with their own Beam Cloud account.
- The main reason we are considering implementing Beam Cloud is because it would allow Nojoin to become a fully hosted SaaS solution for those users that are not technical and just want to go to a website, download a companion, and begin recording meetings with zero technical setup and knowledge.
