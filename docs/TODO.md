# Nojoin To-Do List

## Speaker Inference Logic Improvements - Auto-merging and Unmerging Features

- The speaker inference logic already exists to infer speaker names from the transcript via LLM calls however sometimes the logic results in two speakers being inferred with the same name. We should explore ways to automatically merge these speakers into a single speaker given that the system has inferred the same name for both.
- Conversely, we should also explore ways to UNmerge speakers, regardless of whether they were merged automatically or manually by the user.
- I'm not sure how this would work mechanically, perhaps we could make use of the existing voiceprint recalibration tool/modal/logic to do this since it can be used to pick voice snippets.
- The user could allocate the different voice snippets to two different speakers resulting in the one original speaker being split and a new speaker being created. That way the new speaker starts off with a voiceprint too thanks to the snippets selected by the user. This would require the original speaker being unmerged to have sufficient snippets from both speakers contained within, assuming that a good voiceprint creation requires 3-5 good quality snippets from each speaker.
- Let's discuss this further and see if we can come up with a good plan for implementing this feature.

## Explore Implementing Beam Cloud Compatability

- Beam is an open-source cloud platform that lets you:
  - Run serverless workloads on CPUs and GPUs
  - Securely execute code generated by LLMs in Sandboxes
  - Launch containers in the cloud in under 1 second
  - Instantly deploy any existing Docker image as a REST API
  - Deploy task queues, scheduled jobs, and long-running functions with no timeouts
  - Automatically scale jobs to thousands of containers

- You only pay for the compute you use, by the millisecond of usage.
- See the `Docs/BeamCloud.md` file for more information.
- Let's explore how Nojoin could allow users to make use of a Beam Cloud instance to process their meetings. This would allow users to process their meetings at scale and potentially even process their meetings in parallel without requiring a local machine to do so.
- The user would need to authenticate with their own Beam Cloud account.
- The main reason we are considering implementing Beam Cloud is because it would allow Nojoin to become a fully hosted SaaS solution for those users that are not technical and just want to go to a website, download a companion, and begin recording meetings with zero technical setup and knowledge.
