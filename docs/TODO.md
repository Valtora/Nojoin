## LLM User Context - Medium Priority - Potential TODO
Allow the user to provide the LLMs with some custom context. E.g., their name, title, role, company, and whatever else they want to provide as context to the LLMs. This might help with improving meeting note quality and or provide general quality of life increase for the user.

## Advanced Meeting Analysis - Potential TODO
Implement advanced analyses for both the audio and transcript to gauge things like speaker sentiments, engagement, bias, etc. with a view to extract as much information as possible from the meetings' interactions. Look at things like time spent on topics.

## Settings Dialog - Definite TODO
The 'Advanced' section should be above the 'Updates' section. Also the 'Backup_Restore' label shouldn't have an underscore. It should just be 'Backup/Restore'.

## Processing Recording Dialog - Definite TODO
Add a status message after 'Diarizing...' when participant names are being inferred: 'Inferring Speakers...'.

## Meeting Notes and Context Consolidation - Potential TODO
Find a way to 'combine' or otherwise consolidate meeting notes and context... Develop this idea further first.
