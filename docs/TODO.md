# Nojoin To-Do List

## Meeting Processing UX - Retry Processing Improvements

- Currently, if the user has taken the time to rename speakers in a meeting but they wish to reprocess the transcript, the speaker names will be lost as the system attempts to infer speaker names again.
- There should be logic or guardrails in place that checks to see if speakers have been named manually already by the user, if so, the speaker inference step should be skipped and the existing speaker names should be preserved.
- This may involve some refactoring of the processing pipeline to allow for more flexible speaker inference, especially with regards to the diarization step as the step will now need to consider if speaker names have already been manually assigned and then consider this is the segmentation of the transcript.
- Let's discuss how this could be implemented.

## People Management UX

- Currently all speakers are automatically added/promoted to the global People list. This results the messy creation of speakers after every meeting is processed. Instead People/speakers should exist locally on a per meeting basis unless promoted to a global Person/speaker by the user explicitly. They can do this with the existing 'Add to Speaker Library' button in the context menua available in the speaker management panel. That being said, we should rename that context menu entry to 'Add Person to Library' to make it more clear what it does.

## Explore Implementing Beam Cloud Compatability

- Beam is an open-source cloud platform that lets you:
  - Run serverless workloads on CPUs and GPUs
  - Securely execute code generated by LLMs in Sandboxes
  - Launch containers in the cloud in under 1 second
  - Instantly deploy any existing Docker image as a REST API
  - Deploy task queues, scheduled jobs, and long-running functions with no timeouts
  - Automatically scale jobs to thousands of containers

- You only pay for the compute you use, by the millisecond of usage.
- See the `Docs/BeamCloud.md` file for more information.
- Let's explore how Nojoin could allow users to make use of a Beam Cloud instance to process their meetings. This would allow users to process their meetings at scale and potentially even process their meetings in parallel without requiring a local machine to do so.
- The user would need to authenticate with their own Beam Cloud account.
- The main reason we are considering implementing Beam Cloud is because it would allow Nojoin to become a fully hosted SaaS solution for those users that are not technical and just want to go to a website, download a companion, and begin recording meetings with zero technical setup and knowledge.
