# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Nojoin Wiki!

Welcome! This wiki is the official documentation hub for the Nojoin application. Our goal is to provide clear, comprehensive guides to help you get the most out of every feature.

## What is Nojoin?

Nojoin is an offline-first, privacy-focused desktop application for Windows that allows you to:

*   **Record** your meeting audio (both microphone and system sounds).
*   **Transcribe** the conversation accurately using local processing.
*   **Identify** different speakers automatically.
*   **Generate** AI-powered summaries and ask questions about your meeting content.

It's designed for anyone who wants to keep a private, searchable record of their meetings without sending sensitive audio data to the cloud.

## Getting Started

To get started, please use the links on this page or in the sidebar to navigate to our guides. We recommend starting with the setup and configuration guides, and then exploring features like managing participants and using the Global Speaker Library.
