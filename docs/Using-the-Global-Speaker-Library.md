# Using the Global Speaker Library

The Global Speaker Library is a powerful feature that helps you maintain a consistent list of known speakers across all your recordings. By creating a global profile for a person (e.g., "Jane Smith"), you can easily link them in different meetings, ensuring their name is always consistent.

#### How to Open the Dialog

From the main window, click the **"Global Speakers"** button in the top control bar to open the management dialog.

#### Understanding the Interface

*   **Search Bar:** A fuzzy-search bar to quickly find a speaker in your library, even if you have a typo.
*   **Speaker List:** The main list of all speakers currently in your library.
*   **Name Input Field:** A text box where you can type a new name to add or edit an existing name for renaming.
*   **Action Buttons:**
    *   **Add / Clear Selection:** A context-aware button. It says "Add" when you're ready to create a new entry and "Clear Selection" if you have a speaker selected from the list.
    *   **Rename Selected:** Becomes active when you've selected a speaker and edited their name in the input field.
    *   **Delete Selected:** Becomes active when you select a speaker from the list.

#### Key Actions

**1. Adding a New Speaker**

1.  Make sure no speaker is selected in the list (if one is, click "Clear Selection").
2.  Type the full name of the new speaker into the **Name Input Field**.
3.  Click the **"Add"** button.

The new speaker is now in your library and will appear as a suggestion when you rename participants in the "Manage Participants" dialog.

**2. Renaming a Speaker**

1.  Select the speaker you want to rename from the list. Their name will automatically populate the **Name Input Field**.
2.  Edit the name in the input field.
3.  The **"Rename Selected"** button will become enabled. Click it to save the change.

**3. Deleting a Speaker**

1.  Select the speaker you want to delete from the list.
2.  Click the **"Delete Selected"** button.
3.  A confirmation dialog will appear.
4.  **Important:** Deleting a global speaker does **not** delete them from recordings where they are already named. It simply *unlinks* them. For example, if "Jane Smith" is deleted from the Global Library, her name will remain in any meetings she was part of, but she will no longer be linked to a global profile.
