# Security Policy

The Nojoin team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for your efforts to improve the security of Nojoin. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Active Development

Nojoin is still in active development and all releases should be considered pre-release. There may be security vulnerabilities in the application. Nojoin's maintainers are not responsible for any data loss or security breaches that may occur as a result of using the application. We also advise users to take additional security measures in general but especially when deploying Nojoin over a publically accessible URL. For example, we recommend using a VPN or a reverse proxy to secure your Nojoin instance.

## Supported Versions

As Nojoin is in active development, only the latest version is supported. We encourage all users to use the most up-to-date version of the application.

| Version | Supported          |
