### Meeting List & Context
- Allow for the renaming of meetings via the Meeting Context Display.
- Refactor how the UI is constructed to be more robust.

### Meeting Notes & Transcript
- In settings, allow toggling of meeting note auto save, otherwise it should be manual via a button or CTRL S.
- In general, minimise control via the context menu because most people are stupid and don't realise they can right-click things. For example, have a toggle between Meeting Notes and Meeting Transcript.
- Meeting notes are not generated on first finish of transcription and diarization, particularly when speakers are merged or changed. - Investigate.

### Backend & Data Handling
- Enable parallel processing and recording of meetings.
