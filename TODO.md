### Meeting List & Context
- Add speaker tags to meeting list to see speakers at a glance from the meeting list.
- Meeting titles in Meeting List also need more vertical space.
- Allow for the renaming of meetings via the Meeting Context Display.

### Meeting Notes & Transcript
- In settings, allow toggling of meeting note auto save, otherwise it should be manual via a button or CTRL S.
- Add an undo button AND copy to clipboard button for meeting notes and meeting chat messages.
- In general, minimise control via the context menu because most people are stupid and don't realise they can right-click things. For example, have a toggle between Meeting Notes and Meeting Transcript.

### Backend & Data Handling
- Remove the option to not save transcripts as they are required in the back-end.
- Enable parallel processing and recording of meetings.
- Allow minimum meeting time to be zero, i.e., record any length.
